# PyBer Ride Share Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to aggregate and analyze the ride share data in order to better understand how each city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban) achieve profits for their ride shares. This new data might help reshape what PyBer will do with their resources and priorities in order to help maximize profits throughout all the cities they have drivers working.

## Results

Using the dataframe pictured above as reference, I will describe the differences in the data comparative to each city type.

- Total Rides
    Within the 5 months of collected data, Urban cities tallied 1625 rides, 13 times the number compared to Rural's total of 125 rides.  Suburban cities totaled 625 rides for the same time period.

- Total Drivers
    Even though Rural cities had the fewest amount of drivers, 78, they had the most fares per driver (1.6) compared to Suburban(1.28) and Urban with only (.68)

- Total Fares Collected
    Urban cities collected a total of $39,854 worth of fares. Followd by Suburban, $19,356, and Rural with $4328.
- Average Fare per Ride
    This is where the data becomes a little more interesting.  Even though Rural cities were severely lacking in total fares for the five months, they averaged the highest amount per ride at $34.62, with Suburban next at $30.97 and Urban with $24.53. 
- Average Fare per Driver
    Lastly, Rural drivers fared by far the best when it came to how much each driver averaged based on what type of city they drove in.  Again, Rural was tops with $55.49, Suburban $39.50 and Urban at $16.57 per driver.

The line graph below gives a better visual representation of how much revenue each city type generated per week for the first quarter of 2019.

## Summary

After analyzing the quarterly data provided to me, I have three recommendations in order to best allocate resources and priorities for PyBer to maximize their ride sharing profits.

1. Considering that each ride in Rural cities generates 1.4 times the revenue of each ride versus Urban city type. Marketing resources and number of drivers should increase in Rural cities in order to increase the number of fares per week.

2. Look into possibility of flex rates in Urban cities. Allowing drivers to make more money per ride when customer demand is high for a given week.

3. Considering each driver in Urban cities only averages .68 fares per week, PyBer would need to look deeper into driver idle time and satisfaction to decide if they are carrying too many total drivers in their Urban cities. PyBer should limit total drivers in Urban cities in order to increase driver satisfaction and average fare per ride. Only increasing their driver total if demand for rides can't be met by its current number of drivers.
